The router is the main hub of any Phoenix application. It matches HTTP requests to controller actions, wires up real-time channel handlers, and defines a series of pipeline transformations for scoping middleware to sets of routes.

The router file that Phoenix generates, `web/router.ex`, will look something like this one.

```elixir
defmodule HelloPhoenix.Router do
  use Phoenix.Router

  pipeline :browser do
    plug :accepts, ~w(html)
    plug :fetch_session
    plug :fetch_flash
    plug :protect_from_forgery
  end

  pipeline :api do
    plug :accepts, ~w(json)
  end

  scope "/", HelloPhoenix do
    pipe_through :browser # Use the default browser stack

    get "/", PageController, :index
  end

  # Other scopes may use custom stacks.
  # scope "/api", HelloPhoenix do
  #   pipe_through :api
  # end
end
```
The name you gave your application will appear instead of `HelloPhoenix` for both the router module and controller name.

The first line of this module `use Phoenix.Router` simply makes Phoenix router functions available in our particular router.

Scopes have their own section in this guide, so we won't spend time on the `scope "/", HelloPhoenix do` block here. The `pipe_through :browser` line will get a full treatment in the Pipeline section of this guide. For now, you only need to know that pipelines allow a set of middleware transformations to be applied to different sets of routes.

Inside the scope block, however, we have our first actual route.

```elixir
  get "/", PageController, :index
```

`get` is a Phoenix macro which expands out to define one clause of the `match/3` function. It corresponds to the HTTP verb GET. Similar macros exist for other HTTP verbs including POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, OPTIONS, CONNECT, TRACE and HEAD.

The first argument to these macros is the path. Here, it is the root of the application, `/`. The next two arguments are the controller and action we want to have handle this request. These macros may also take other options, which we will see throughout the rest of this guide.

If this were the only route in our router module, the clause of the `match/3` function would look like this after the macro expands.

```elixir
  def match(conn, "GET", ["/"]) do
    Controller.perform_action(conn, HelloPhoenix.PageController, :index)
  end
```

The body of the match function sets up the connection and invokes the matched controller action.

As we add more routes, more clauses of the match function will be added to our router module. These will behave like any other multi-clause function in Elixir. They will be tried in order from the top, and the first clause to match the parameters given (verb and path) will be executed. After a match is found, the search will stop and no other clauses will by tried.

This means that it is possible to create a route which will never match, based on the HTTP verb and the path, regardless of the controller and action.

If we do create an ambiguous route, the router will still compile, but we will get a warning. Let's see this in action.

Define this route at the bottom of the `scope "/", HelloPhoenix do` block in the router.

```elixir
get "/", RootController, :index
```

Then run `$ mix compile` at the root of your project. You will see the following warning from the compiler.

```text
web/router.ex:1: warning: this clause cannot match because a previous clause at line 1 always matches
Compiled web/router.ex
```

###Examining Routes

Phoenix provides a great tool for investigating routes in an application, the mix task `phoenix.routes`.

Let's see how this works. Go to the root of a newly-generated Phoenix application and run `$ mix phoenix.routes`. (If you haven't already done so, you'll need to run `$ mix do deps.get, compile` before running the routes task.) You should see something like the following, generated from the only route we currently have.

```console
$ mix phoenix.routes
page_path  GET  /  HelloPhoenix.PageController.index/2
```
The output tells us that any HTTP GET request for the root of the application will be handled by the `index` action of the `HelloPhoenix.PageController`.

`page_path` is an instance of a what Phoenix calls a path helper, and we'll talk about those very soon.

###Resources

The router supports other macros besides those for HTTP verbs like `get`, `post` and `put`. The most important among them is `resources`, which expands out to eight clauses of the match function.

Let's add a resource to our `web/router.ex` file like this.

```elixir
scope "/", HelloPhoenix do
  pipe_through :browser # Use the default browser stack

  get "/", PageController, :index
  resources "/users", UserController
end
```
For this purpose, it doesn't matter that we don't actually have a `HelloPhoenix.UserController`.

Then go to the root of your project, and run `$ mix phoenix.routes`

You should see something like the following. Of course, the name of your project will replace `HelloPhoenix`.

```elixir
user_path  GET     /users           HelloPhoenix.UserController.index/2
user_path  GET     /users/:id/edit  HelloPhoenix.UserController.edit/2
user_path  GET     /users/new       HelloPhoenix.UserController.new/2
user_path  GET     /users/:id       HelloPhoenix.UserController.show/2
user_path  POST    /users           HelloPhoenix.UserController.create/2
user_path  PATCH   /users/:id       HelloPhoenix.UserController.update/2
           PUT     /users/:id       HelloPhoenix.UserController.update/2
user_path  DELETE  /users/:id       HelloPhoenix.UserController.delete/2
```
This is the standard matrix of HTTP verbs, paths and controller actions. Let's look at them individually, in a slightly different order.

- A GET request to `/users` will invoke the `index` action to show all the users.
- A GET request to `/users/:id` will invoke the `show` action with an id to show an individual user identified by that id.
- A GET request to `/users/new` will invoke the `new` action to present a form for creating a new user.
- A POST request to `/users` will invoke the `create` action to save a new user to the data store.
- A GET request to `/users/:id/edit` will invoke the `edit` action with an id to retrieve an individual user from the data store and present the information in a form for editing.
- A PATCH request to `/users/:id` will invoke the `update` action with an id to save the updated user to the data store.
- A PUT request to `/users/:id` will also invoke the `update` action with an id to save the updated use to the data store.
- A DELETE request to `/users/:id` will invoke the `delete` action with an id to remove the individual user from the data store.

If we don't feel that we need all of these routes, we can be selective using the `:only` and `:except` options.

Let's say we have a read-only posts resource. We could define it like this.

```elixir
resources "posts", PostController, only: [:index, :show]
```

Running `$ mix phoenix.routes` shows that we now only have the routes to the index and show actions defined.

```elixir
post_path  GET     /posts                         HelloPhoenix.PostsController.index/2
post_path  GET     /posts/:id                     HelloPhoenix.PostsController.show/2
```

Similarly, if we have a comments resource, and we don't want to provide a route to delete one, we could define a route like this.

```elixir
resources "comments", CommentController, except: [:delete]
```

Running `$ mix phoenix.routes` now shows that we have all the routes except the DELETE request to the delete action.

```elixir
comment_path  GET     /comments                      HelloPhoenix.CommentController.index/2
comment_path  GET     /comments/:id/edit             HelloPhoenix.CommentController.edit/2
comment_path  GET     /comments/new                  HelloPhoenix.CommentController.new/2
comment_path  GET     /comments/:id                  HelloPhoenix.CommentController.show/2
comment_path  POST    /comments                      HelloPhoenix.CommentController.create/2
comment_path  PATCH   /comments/:id                  HelloPhoenix.CommentController.update/2
              PUT     /comments/:id                  HelloPhoenix.CommentController.update/2
```
###Path Helpers

Path helpers are functions which are dynamically defined on the `Router.Helpers` module for an individual application. For us, that is `HelloPhoenix.Router.Helpers`.  Their names are derived from the name of the controller used in the route definition. Our controller is `HelloPhoenix.PageController`, and `page_path` is the function which will return the path to the root of our application.

That's a mouthful. Let's see it in action. Run `$ iex -S mix` at the root of the project. When we call the `page_path` function on our router helpers with the the `Endpoint` or connection and action as arguments, it returns the path to us.

```elixir
iex(4)> HelloPhoenix.Router.Helpers.page_path(Endpoint, :index)
"/"
```

This is significant because we can use the `page_path` function in a template to link to the root of our application.

```html
<a href="<%= HelloPhoenix.Router.Helpers.page_path(@conn, :index) %>">To the Welcome Page!</a>
```
Note: If that function invocation seems uncomfortably long, there is a solution. By including `import HelloPhoenix.Router.Helpers` in our main application view, we can shorten that to `page_path(@conn, :index)`. Please see the [View Guide](http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/views) for more information.

This pays off tremendously if we should ever have to change the path of our route in the router. Since the path helpers are built dynamically from the routes, any calls to `page_path` in our templates will still work.

###More on Path Helpers

When we ran the `phoenix.routes` task for our user resource, it listed the `user_path` as the path helper function for each line of output. Here is what that translates to for each action.

```elixir
iex(2)> HelloPhoenix.Router.Helpers.user_path(Endpoint, :index)
"/users"

iex(3)> HelloPhoenix.Router.Helpers.user_path(Endpoint, :show, 17)
"/users/17"

iex(4)> HelloPhoenix.Router.Helpers.user_path(Endpoint, :new)
"/users/new"

iex(5)> HelloPhoenix.Router.Helpers.user_path(Endpoint, :create)
"/users"

iex(6)> HelloPhoenix.Router.Helpers.user_path(Endpoint, :edit, 37)
"/users/37/edit"

iex(7)> HelloPhoenix.Router.Helpers.user_path(Endpoint, :update, 37)
"/users/37"

iex(8)> HelloPhoenix.Router.Helpers.user_path(Endpoint, :delete, 17)
"/users/17"
```

What about paths with query strings? Phoenix has you covered. By adding an optional fourth argument of key value pairs, the path helpers will return those pairs in the query string.
```elixir
iex(3)> HelloPhoenix.Router.Helpers.user_path(Endpoint, :show, 17, admin: true, active: false)
"/users/17?admin=true&active=false"
```

What if we need a full url instead of a path? Again, Phoenix has an answer. In order to get a full url, we pipe the result of the `user_path/2` function into `Endpoint.url/1`.

```elixir
iex(3)> HelloPhoenix.Router.Helpers.user_path(Endpoint, :index) |> HelloPhoenix.Endpoint.url
"http://localhost:4000/users"
```
Application endpoints will have their own guide soon. For now, think of them as the entity that handles requests just up to the point where the router takes over. That includes starting the app/server, applying configuration, and applying the plugs common to all requests.

The `Endpoint.url/1` function will get the host, port, proxy port and ssl information needed to construct the full url from the configuration parameters set for each environment. We'll talk about configuration in more detail in its own guide. For now, you can take a look at `/config/dev.exs` file in your own project to see what those values are.

###Nested Resources

It is also possible to nest resources in a Phoenix router. Let's say we also have a posts resource which has a one to many relationship with users. That is to say, a user can create many posts, and an individual post belongs to only one user. We can represent that by adding a nested route in `web/router.ex` like this.

```elixir
resources "users", UserController do
  resources "posts", PostController
end
```
When we run `$ mix phoenix.routes` now, in addition to the routes we saw for users above, we get the following set of routes:

```elixir
...
user_post_path  GET     users/:user_id/posts           HelloPhoenix.PostController.index/2
user_post_path  GET     users/:user_id/posts/:id/edit  HelloPhoenix.PostController.edit/2
user_post_path  GET     users/:user_id/posts/new       HelloPhoenix.PostController.new/2
user_post_path  GET     users/:user_id/posts/:id       HelloPhoenix.PostController.show/2
user_post_path  POST    users/:user_id/posts           HelloPhoenix.PostController.create/2
user_post_path  PATCH   users/:user_id/posts/:id       HelloPhoenix.PostController.update/2
                PUT     users/:user_id/posts/:id       HelloPhoenix.PostController.update/2
user_post_path  DELETE  users/:user_id/posts/:id       HelloPhoenix.PostController.delete/2
```

We see that each of these routes scopes the posts to a user id. For the first one, we will invoke the `PostController` `index` action, but we will pass in a `user_id`. This implies that we would display all the posts for that individual user only. The same scoping applies for all these routes.

When calling path helper functions for nested routes, we will need to pass the ids in the order they came in the route definition. For the following `show` route, `42` is the `user_id`, and `17` is the `post_id`.

```elixir
iex(2)> HelloPhoenix.Router.Helpers.user_post_path(Endpoint, :show, 42, 17)
"/users/42/posts/17"
```

Again, if we add a key value pair to the end of the function call, it is added to the query string.

```elixir
iex> HelloPhoenix.Router.Helpers.user_post_path(Endpoint, :index, 42, active: true)
"/users/42/posts?active=true"
```

###Scoped Routes

Scopes are a way to group routes under a common path prefix. We might want to do this for admin functionality, APIs  and especially for versioned APIs. Let's say we have user generated reviews on a site, and that those reviews first need to be approved by an admin. The semantics of these resources are quite different, and they may not share the same controller, so we want to keep them separate.

The paths to the user facing reviews would look like a standard resource.

```text
/reviews
/reviews/1234
/reviews/1234/edit

and so on
```

The admin review paths could be prefixed with `/admin`.

```text
/admin/reviews
/admin/reviews/1234
/admin/reviews/1234/edit

and so on
```

We accomplish this with a scoped route that sets a path option to `/admin` like this one. For now, let's not nest this scope inside of any other scopes (like the `scope "/", HelloPhoenix do` one provided for us in a new app).

```elixir
scope "/admin" do
  pipe_through :browser

  resources "/reviews", HelloPhoenix.Admin.ReviewController
end
```

Note that Phoenix will assume that the path we set ought to begin with a slash, so `scope "/admin" do` and `scope "admin" do` will both produce the same results.

Note also, that the way this scope is currently defined, we need to fully qualify our controller name, `Admin.ReviewController`. We'll fix that in a minute.

Running `$ mix phoenix.routes` again, in addition to the previous set of routes we get the following:

```elixir
...
review_path  GET     /admin/reviews           HelloPhoenix.Admin.ReviewController.index/2
review_path  GET     /admin/reviews/:id/edit  HelloPhoenix.Admin.ReviewController.edit/2
review_path  GET     /admin/reviews/new       HelloPhoenix.Admin.ReviewController.new/2
review_path  GET     /admin/reviews/:id       HelloPhoenix.Admin.ReviewController.show/2
review_path  POST    /admin/reviews           HelloPhoenix.Admin.ReviewController.create/2
review_path  PATCH   /admin/reviews/:id       HelloPhoenix.Admin.ReviewController.update/2
             PUT     /admin/reviews/:id       HelloPhoenix.Admin.ReviewController.update/2
review_path  DELETE  /admin/reviews/:id       HelloPhoenix.Admin.ReviewController.delete/2
```

This looks good, but there is a problem here. Remember that we wanted both user facing reviews routes `/reviews` as well as the admin `/admin/reviews` ones. If we now include the user facing reviews in our router like this:

```elixir
scope "/", HelloPhoenix do
  pipe_through :browser
  ...
  resources "/reviews", ReviewController
  ...
end

scope "/admin" do
  resources "/reviews", HelloPhoenix.Admin.ReviewController
end
```

and we run `$ mix phoenix.routes`, we get this output:

```elixir
...
review_path  GET     /reviews                 HelloPhoenix.ReviewController.index/2
review_path  GET     /reviews/:id/edit        HelloPhoenix.ReviewController.edit/2
review_path  GET     /reviews/new             HelloPhoenix.ReviewController.new/2
review_path  GET     /reviews/:id             HelloPhoenix.ReviewController.show/2
review_path  POST    /reviews                 HelloPhoenix.ReviewController.create/2
review_path  PATCH   /reviews/:id             HelloPhoenix.ReviewController.update/2
             PUT     /reviews/:id             HelloPhoenix.ReviewController.update/2
review_path  DELETE  /reviews/:id             HelloPhoenix.ReviewController.delete/2
...
review_path  GET     /admin/reviews           HelloPhoenix.Admin.ReviewController.index/2
review_path  GET     /admin/reviews/:id/edit  HelloPhoenix.Admin.ReviewController.edit/2
review_path  GET     /admin/reviews/new       HelloPhoenix.Admin.ReviewController.new/2
review_path  GET     /admin/reviews/:id       HelloPhoenix.Admin.ReviewController.show/2
review_path  POST    /admin/reviews           HelloPhoenix.Admin.ReviewController.create/2
review_path  PATCH   /admin/reviews/:id       HelloPhoenix.Admin.ReviewController.update/2
             PUT     /admin/reviews/:id       HelloPhoenix.Admin.ReviewController.update/2
review_path  DELETE  /admin/reviews/:id       HelloPhoenix.Admin.ReviewController.delete/2
```

The actual routes we get all look right, except for the path helper `review_path` at the beginning of each line. We are getting the same helper for both the user facing review routes and the admin ones which is not correct. We can fix this problem by adding an `as: :admin` option to our admin scope.

```elixir
scope "/", HelloPhoenix do
  pipe_through :browser
  ...
  resources "/reviews", ReviewController
  ...
end

scope "/admin", as: :admin do
  resources "/reviews", HelloPhoenix.Admin.ReviewController
end
```

`$ mix phoenix.routes` now shows us we have what we are looking for.

```elixir
...
      review_path  GET     /reviews                 HelloPhoenix.ReviewController.index/2
      review_path  GET     /reviews/:id/edit        HelloPhoenix.ReviewController.edit/2
      review_path  GET     /reviews/new             HelloPhoenix.ReviewController.new/2
      review_path  GET     /reviews/:id             HelloPhoenix.ReviewController.show/2
      review_path  POST    /reviews                 HelloPhoenix.ReviewController.create/2
      review_path  PATCH   /reviews/:id             HelloPhoenix.ReviewController.update/2
                   PUT     /reviews/:id             HelloPhoenix.ReviewController.update/2
      review_path  DELETE  /reviews/:id             HelloPhoenix.ReviewController.delete/2
...
admin_review_path  GET     /admin/reviews           HelloPhoenix.Admin.ReviewController.index/2
admin_review_path  GET     /admin/reviews/:id/edit  HelloPhoenix.Admin.ReviewController.edit/2
admin_review_path  GET     /admin/reviews/new       HelloPhoenix.Admin.ReviewController.new/2
admin_review_path  GET     /admin/reviews/:id       HelloPhoenix.Admin.ReviewController.show/2
admin_review_path  POST    /admin/reviews           HelloPhoenix.Admin.ReviewController.create/2
admin_review_path  PATCH   /admin/reviews/:id       HelloPhoenix.Admin.ReviewController.update/2
                   PUT     /admin/reviews/:id       HelloPhoenix.Admin.ReviewController.update/2
admin_review_path  DELETE  /admin/reviews/:id       HelloPhoenix.Admin.ReviewController.delete/2
...
```

The path helpers now return what we want them to as well. Run `$ iex -S mix` and give it a try yourself.

```elixir
iex(1)> HelloPhoenix.Router.Helpers.review_path(Endpoint, :index)
"/reviews"

iex(2)> HelloPhoenix.Router.Helpers.admin_review_path(Endpoint, :show, 1234)
"/admin/reviews/1234"
```

What if we had a number of resources that were all handled by admins? We could put all of them inside the same scope like this:

```elixir
scope "/admin", as: :admin do
  pipe_through :browser

  resources "/images", HelloPhoenix.Admin.ImageController
  resources "/reviews", HelloPhoenix.Admin.ReviewController
  resources "/users", HelloPhoenix.Admin.UserController
end
```

Here's what `$ mix phoenix.routes` tells us:

```elixir
...
 admin_image_path  GET     /admin/images            HelloPhoenix.Admin.ImageController.index/2
 admin_image_path  GET     /admin/images/:id/edit   HelloPhoenix.Admin.ImageController.edit/2
 admin_image_path  GET     /admin/images/new        HelloPhoenix.Admin.ImageController.new/2
 admin_image_path  GET     /admin/images/:id        HelloPhoenix.Admin.ImageController.show/2
 admin_image_path  POST    /admin/images            HelloPhoenix.Admin.ImageController.create/2
 admin_image_path  PATCH   /admin/images/:id        HelloPhoenix.Admin.ImageController.update/2
                   PUT     /admin/images/:id        HelloPhoenix.Admin.ImageController.update/2
 admin_image_path  DELETE  /admin/images/:id        HelloPhoenix.Admin.ImageController.delete/2
admin_review_path  GET     /admin/reviews           HelloPhoenix.Admin.ReviewController.index/2
admin_review_path  GET     /admin/reviews/:id/edit  HelloPhoenix.Admin.ReviewController.edit/2
admin_review_path  GET     /admin/reviews/new       HelloPhoenix.Admin.ReviewController.new/2
admin_review_path  GET     /admin/reviews/:id       HelloPhoenix.Admin.ReviewController.show/2
admin_review_path  POST    /admin/reviews           HelloPhoenix.Admin.ReviewController.create/2
admin_review_path  PATCH   /admin/reviews/:id       HelloPhoenix.Admin.ReviewController.update/2
                   PUT     /admin/reviews/:id       HelloPhoenix.Admin.ReviewController.update/2
admin_review_path  DELETE  /admin/reviews/:id       HelloPhoenix.Admin.ReviewController.delete/2
  admin_user_path  GET     /admin/users             HelloPhoenix.Admin.UserController.index/2
  admin_user_path  GET     /admin/users/:id/edit    HelloPhoenix.Admin.UserController.edit/2
  admin_user_path  GET     /admin/users/new         HelloPhoenix.Admin.UserController.new/2
  admin_user_path  GET     /admin/users/:id         HelloPhoenix.Admin.UserController.show/2
  admin_user_path  POST    /admin/users             HelloPhoenix.Admin.UserController.create/2
  admin_user_path  PATCH   /admin/users/:id         HelloPhoenix.Admin.UserController.update/2
                   PUT     /admin/users/:id         HelloPhoenix.Admin.UserController.update/2
  admin_user_path  DELETE  /admin/users/:id         HelloPhoenix.Admin.UserController.delete/2
```

This is great, exactly what we want, but we can make it even better. Notice that for each resource, we needed to fully qualify the controller name by prefixing it with `HelloPhoenix.Admin`. That's tedious and error prone. Assuming that the name of each controller begins with `HelloPhoenix.Admin`, then we can add a `HelloPhoenix.Admin` option to our scope declaration just after the scope path, and all of our routes will have the correct, fully qualified controller name.

```elixir
scope "/admin", HelloPhoenix.Admin, as: :admin do
  pipe_through :browser

  resources "/images", ImageController
  resources "/reviews", ReviewController
  resources "/users", UserController
end
```

Now run `$ mix phoenix.routes` again and you can see that we get the same result as above when we qualified each controller name individually.

As an extra bonus, we could nest all of the routes for our application inside a scope that simply has an alias for the name of our Phoenix app, and eliminate the duplication in our controller names.

Phoenix already does this now for us in the generated router for a new application (see beginning of this section). Notice here the use of `HelloPhoenix.Router` in the `defmodule` declaration:

```elixir
defmodule HelloPhoenix.Router do
  use Phoenix.Router

  scope "/", HelloPhoenix do
    pipe_through :browser

    get "/images", ImageController, :index
    resources "/reviews", ReviewController
    resources "/users", UserController
  end
end
```

Again `$ mix phoenix.routes` tells us that all of our controllers now have the correct, fully-qualified names.

```elixir
 image_path  GET     /images            HelloPhoenix.ImageController.index/2
review_path  GET     /reviews           HelloPhoenix.ReviewController.index/2
review_path  GET     /reviews/:id/edit  HelloPhoenix.ReviewController.edit/2
review_path  GET     /reviews/new       HelloPhoenix.ReviewController.new/2
review_path  GET     /reviews/:id       HelloPhoenix.ReviewController.show/2
review_path  POST    /reviews           HelloPhoenix.ReviewController.create/2
review_path  PATCH   /reviews/:id       HelloPhoenix.ReviewController.update/2
             PUT     /reviews/:id       HelloPhoenix.ReviewController.update/2
review_path  DELETE  /reviews/:id       HelloPhoenix.ReviewController.delete/2
  user_path  GET     /users             HelloPhoenix.UserController.index/2
  user_path  GET     /users/:id/edit    HelloPhoenix.UserController.edit/2
  user_path  GET     /users/new         HelloPhoenix.UserController.new/2
  user_path  GET     /users/:id         HelloPhoenix.UserController.show/2
  user_path  POST    /users             HelloPhoenix.UserController.create/2
  user_path  PATCH   /users/:id         HelloPhoenix.UserController.update/2
             PUT     /users/:id         HelloPhoenix.UserController.update/2
  user_path  DELETE  /users/:id         HelloPhoenix.UserController.delete/2
```

Scopes can also be nested, just like resources. Suppose that we had a versioned API with resources defined for images, reviews and users. We could then setup routes for the versioned API like this:

```elixir
scope "/api", HelloPhoenix.Api, as: :api do
  pipe_through :api

  scope "/v1", V1, as: :v1 do
    resources "/images", ImageController
    resources "/reviews", ReviewController
    resources "/users", UserController
  end
end
```

`$ mix phoenix.routes` tells us that we have the routes we're looking for.

```elixir
 api_v1_image_path  GET     /api/v1/images            HelloPhoenix.Api.V1.ImageController.index/2
 api_v1_image_path  GET     /api/v1/images/:id/edit   HelloPhoenix.Api.V1.ImageController.edit/2
 api_v1_image_path  GET     /api/v1/images/new        HelloPhoenix.Api.V1.ImageController.new/2
 api_v1_image_path  GET     /api/v1/images/:id        HelloPhoenix.Api.V1.ImageController.show/2
 api_v1_image_path  POST    /api/v1/images            HelloPhoenix.Api.V1.ImageController.create/2
 api_v1_image_path  PATCH   /api/v1/images/:id        HelloPhoenix.Api.V1.ImageController.update/2
                    PUT     /api/v1/images/:id        HelloPhoenix.Api.V1.ImageController.update/2
 api_v1_image_path  DELETE  /api/v1/images/:id        HelloPhoenix.Api.V1.ImageController.delete/2
api_v1_review_path  GET     /api/v1/reviews           HelloPhoenix.Api.V1.ReviewController.index/2
api_v1_review_path  GET     /api/v1/reviews/:id/edit  HelloPhoenix.Api.V1.ReviewController.edit/2
api_v1_review_path  GET     /api/v1/reviews/new       HelloPhoenix.Api.V1.ReviewController.new/2
api_v1_review_path  GET     /api/v1/reviews/:id       HelloPhoenix.Api.V1.ReviewController.show/2
api_v1_review_path  POST    /api/v1/reviews           HelloPhoenix.Api.V1.ReviewController.create/2
api_v1_review_path  PATCH   /api/v1/reviews/:id       HelloPhoenix.Api.V1.ReviewController.update/2
                    PUT     /api/v1/reviews/:id       HelloPhoenix.Api.V1.ReviewController.update/2
api_v1_review_path  DELETE  /api/v1/reviews/:id       HelloPhoenix.Api.V1.ReviewController.delete/2
  api_v1_user_path  GET     /api/v1/users             HelloPhoenix.Api.V1.UserController.index/2
  api_v1_user_path  GET     /api/v1/users/:id/edit    HelloPhoenix.Api.V1.UserController.edit/2
  api_v1_user_path  GET     /api/v1/users/new         HelloPhoenix.Api.V1.UserController.new/2
  api_v1_user_path  GET     /api/v1/users/:id         HelloPhoenix.Api.V1.UserController.show/2
  api_v1_user_path  POST    /api/v1/users             HelloPhoenix.Api.V1.UserController.create/2
  api_v1_user_path  PATCH   /api/v1/users/:id         HelloPhoenix.Api.V1.UserController.update/2
                    PUT     /api/v1/users/:id         HelloPhoenix.Api.V1.UserController.update/2
  api_v1_user_path  DELETE  /api/v1/users/:id         HelloPhoenix.Api.V1.UserController.delete/2
```
Interestingly, we can use multiple scopes with the same path as long as we are careful not to duplicate routes (resources). If we do duplicate a route, we'll get this familiar warning.

```console
warning: this clause cannot match because a previous clause at line 16 always matches
```
This router is perfectly fine with two scopes defined for the same path.

```elixir
defmodule HelloPhoenix.Router do
  use Phoenix.Router
  ...
  scope "/", HelloPhoenix do
    pipe_through :browser

    resources "users", UserController
  end

  scope "/", AnotherApp do
    pipe_through :browser

    resources "posts", PostController # cannot be "users"
  end
  ...
end
```
And when we run `$ mix phoenix.routes`, we see the following output.

```elixir
user_path  GET     /users           HelloPhoenix.UserController.index/2
user_path  GET     /users/:id/edit  HelloPhoenix.UserController.edit/2
user_path  GET     /users/new       HelloPhoenix.UserController.new/2
user_path  GET     /users/:id       HelloPhoenix.UserController.show/2
user_path  POST    /users           HelloPhoenix.UserController.create/2
user_path  PATCH   /users/:id       HelloPhoenix.UserController.update/2
           PUT     /users/:id       HelloPhoenix.UserController.update/2
user_path  DELETE  /users/:id       HelloPhoenix.UserController.delete/2
post_path  GET     /posts           AnotherApp.PostController.index/2
post_path  GET     /posts/:id/edit  AnotherApp.PostController.edit/2
post_path  GET     /posts/new       AnotherApp.PostController.new/2
post_path  GET     /posts/:id       AnotherApp.PostController.show/2
post_path  POST    /posts           AnotherApp.PostController.create/2
post_path  PATCH   /posts/:id       AnotherApp.PostController.update/2
           PUT     /posts/:id       AnotherApp.PostController.update/2
post_path  DELETE  /posts/:id       AnotherApp.PostController.delete/2
```

###Pipelines

We have come quite a long way in this guide without talking about one of the first lines we saw in the router - `pipe_through :browser`. It's time to fix that.

Remember in the [Overview Guide](http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/overview) when we described plugs as being stacked and executable in a pre-determined order, like a pipeline? Now we're going to take a closer look at how these plug stacks work in the router.

Pipelines are simply plugs stacked up together in a specific order and given a name. They allow us to customize behaviors and transformations related to the handling of requests. Phoenix provides us with some default pipelines for a number of common tasks. In turn we can customize them as well as creating new pipelines to meet our needs.

A newly generated Phoenix application defines two pipelines called `:browser` and `:api`. We'll get to those in a minute, but first we need to talk about the plug stack in the Endpoint plugs.

#####The Endpoint Plugs

The endpoint is the boundary where all requests start, thereby exposing the application interface to the underlying web services. It has three responsibilities:

- Provide a wrapper for starting and stopping the endpoint as part of a supervision tree.
- Define an initial plug pipeline to which requests are sent.
- Host web specific configuration for your application.

Older versions of Phoenix defined a third pipeline `:before`. Its purpose was to organize all the plugs common to every request, and make sure they were executed first, before the `:browser` or `:api` pipelines. Currently, the Endpoint has taken over this responsibility. These Endpoint plugs do quite a lot of work. Here they are in order.

- [Plug.Static](http://hexdocs.pm/plug/Plug.Static.html) - serves static assets. Since this plug comes before the router, serving of static assets is not logged

- [Plug.Logger](http://hexdocs.pm/plug/Plug.Logger.html) - logs incoming requests

- [Phoenix.CodeReloader](http://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.CodeReloader.html) - a plug that enables code reloading for all entries in the web directory. It is configured directly in the Phoenix application

- [Plug.Parsers](http://hexdocs.pm/plug/Plug.Parsers.html) - parses the request body when a known parser is available. By default parsers urlencoded, multipart and json (with poison). The request body is left untouched when the request content-type cannot be parsed

- [Plug.MethodOverride](http://hexdocs.pm/plug/Plug.MethodOverride.html) - converts the request method to
  PUT, PATCH or DELETE for POST requests with a valid `_method` parameter

- [Plug.Head](http://hexdocs.pm/plug/Plug.Head.html) - converts HEAD requests to GET requests and strips the response body

- [Plug.Session](http://hexdocs.pm/plug/Plug.Session.html) - a plug that sets up session management.
  Note that fetch_session/2 must still be explicitly called before using the session as this plug just sets up how the session is fetched

- [Plug.Router](http://hexdocs.pm/plug/Plug.Router.html) - plugs our router into the request cycle

#####The `:browser` and `:api` Pipelines

Phoenix defines two other pipelines by default, `:browser` and `:api`. The router will invoke these after it matches a route, assuming we have called `pipe_through/1` with them in the enclosing scope.

As their names suggest, the `:browser` pipeline prepares for routes which render HTML for a browser. The `:api` pipeline prepares for routes which produce data for an api, for example JSON.

The `:browser` pipeline has four plugs: `plug :accepts, ~w(html)` which defines the request format or formats which will be accepted, `:fetch_session`, which, naturally, fetches the session data and makes it available in the connection, `:fetch_flash` which retrieves any flash messages which may have been set, and `:protect_from_forgery`, which protects form posts from cross site forgery.

Currently our example so far, the `:api` pipeline only defines `plug :accepts, ~w(json)`.

The router invokes a pipeline on a route defined within a scope. If no scope is defined, the router will invoke the pipeline on all
the routes in the router. If from within a nested scope we call `pipe_through/1`, the router will invoke it on the inner scope only.

That's quite a few words bunched up together, so let's take a closer look at some examples to untangle their meaning and clarify
things.

Here's another look at the router from a newly generated Phoenix application, this time with the api scope uncommented back in and a route added.
```elixir
defmodule HelloPhoenix.Router do
  use Phoenix.Router

  pipeline :browser do
    plug :accepts, ~w(html)
    plug :fetch_session
    plug :fetch_flash
    plug :protect_from_forgery
  end

  pipeline :api do
    plug :accepts, ~w(json)
  end

  scope "/", HelloPhoenix do
    pipe_through :browser

    get "/", PageController, :index
  end

  # Other scopes may use custom stacks.
  scope "/api", HelloPhoenix do
    pipe_through :api

    resources "reviews", ReviewController
  end
end
```
When the server accepts a request, the request will always first pass through the plugs in our Endpoint, after which it will attempt to match on the path and HTTP verb.

Let's say that the request matches our first route: a GET to `/`. The router will first pipe that request through the `:browser` pipeline - which will fetch the session data, fetch the flash, and execute forgery protection - before it dispatches the request to the `PageController` `index` action.

Conversely, if the request matches any of the routes defined by the `resources/2` macro, the router will pipe it through the `:api`
pipeline - which currently does nothing - before it dispatches further to the correct action of the `HelloPhoenix.ReviewController`.

If we know that our application only renders views for the browser, we can simplify our router quite a bit by removing the `api`
stuff as well as the scopes:

```elixir
defmodule HelloPhoenix.Router do
  use Phoenix.Router

  pipeline :browser do
    plug :accepts, ~w(html)
    plug :fetch_session
    plug :fetch_flash
    plug :protect_from_forgery
  end

  pipe_through :browser

  get "/", HelloPhoenix.PageController, :index

  resources "reviews", HelloPhoenix.ReviewController
end
```
Removing all scopes forces the router to invoke the `:browser` pipeline on all routes.

Let's stretch these ideas out a little bit more. What if we need to pipe requests through both `:browser` and one or more custom pipelines? We simply `pipe_through` a list of pipelines, and Phoenix will invoke them in order.

```elixir
defmodule HelloPhoenix.Router do
  use Phoenix.Router

  pipeline :browser do
    plug :accepts, ~w(html)
    plug :fetch_session
    plug :fetch_flash
    plug :protect_from_forgery
  end
  ...

  scope "/reviews" do
    # Use the default browser stack.
    pipe_through [:browser, :review_checks, :other_great_stuff]

    resources "reviews", HelloPhoenix.ReviewController
  end
end
```

Here's another example where nested scopes have different pipelines.

```elixir
defmodule HelloPhoenix.Router do
  use Phoenix.Router

  pipeline :browser do
    plug :accepts, ~w(html)
    plug :fetch_session
    plug :fetch_flash
    plug :protect_from_forgery
  end
  ...

  scope "/", HelloPhoenix do
    pipe_through :browser

    resources "posts", PostController

    scope "/reviews" do
      pipe_through :review_checks

      resources "reviews", ReviewController
    end
  end
end
```

In general, the scoping rules for pipelines behave as you would expect. In this example, all routes will pipe through the `:browser` pipeline, because the `/` scope encloses all the routes. Only the `reviews` resources routes will additionally pipe through the `:review_checks` pipeline, because we declare `pipe_through :review_checks` within the `/reviews` scope, where the `reviews` resources routes are.

#####Creating New Pipelines
Phoenix allows us to create our own custom pipelines anywhere in the router. It couldn't be simpler. We just call the `pipeline/2` macro with an atom for the name of our new pipeline and a block with all the plugs we want in it.

```elixir
defmodule HelloPhoenix.Router do
  use Phoenix.Router

  pipeline :browser do
    plug :accepts, ~w(html)
    plug :fetch_session
    plug :fetch_flash
    plug :protect_from_forgery
  end

  pipeline :review_checks do
    plug :ensure_authenticated_user
    plug :ensure_user_owns_review
  end

  scope "/reviews", HelloPhoenix do
    pipe_through :review_checks

    resources "reviews", ReviewController
  end
end
```

###Channel Routes

Channels are a very exciting, real-time component of the Phoenix framework. They are so important that they will have a Channel Guide of their own very soon.

Channels are roughly analogous to controllers, except that they are capable of bi-directional communication and their connections persist beyond the initial response. They are also closely tied to a client - written for JavaScript, iOS or Android.

For the time being, we'll focus on defining channel routes and postpone a detailed discussion of their capabilities to the Channel Guide.

Each channel depends on a socket mounted at a given point for its communication. We can define the socket in a way that looks a lot like a scope for a regular route. We define a `socket` block with a path to the socket's mount point and the name of our application to fully qualify our channel name.

Here's what that looks like in our router file:

```elixir
defmodule HelloPhoenix.Router do
  use Phoenix.Router

  socket "/ws", HelloPhoenix do
  end
  ...
end
```

Next, we need to define a channel, specifying a topic and associating it with the channel module which will implement its behavior.  Assuming that we have a channel module called `RoomChannel` and a topic called `lobby`, the code to do this is pretty straightforward:

```elixir
defmodule HelloPhoenix.Router do
  use Phoenix.Router

  socket "/ws", HelloPhoenix do
    channel "rooms:*", RoomChannel # Will match all topics which begin with "rooms:"
  end
  ...
end
```
###Summary

Routing is a big topic, and we have covered a lot of ground here. The important points to take away from this guide are:
- Routes which begin with an HTTP verb name expand to a single clause of the match function.
- Routes which begin with 'resources' expand to 8 clauses of the match function: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE.
- Resources may restrict the number of match function clauses by using the `only:` or `except:` options.
- Any of these routes may be nested.
- Any of these routes may be scoped to a given path.
- Using the `as:` option in a scope can reduce duplication.
- Using the helper option for scoped routes eliminates unreachable paths.
- Scoped routes may also be nested.
